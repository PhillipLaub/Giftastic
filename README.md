# GiftasticWhat the project does
-Why the project is useful

This project allows the user to pull 10 gifs from the Giphy API. The gifs will go still, or animate with a click from the user. The user can also add additional buttons to search for gifs of their choosing. This project helps with the understanding of using and accessing APIs and dynamically creating elements.

-How users can get started with the project

Start with initial file creation of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML layout should be simple, not too much code goes into HTML other than basic layout, just containers, and the form for user input. Make sure to link all files and do a simple test to make sure they are working together. The bulk of the work in this project lies in the javascript. You'll need to create an array of topics, and variables for cut off rating, limit if you choose, etc. Link to the Giphy API and add your API key. Edit the link to include a search variable to be inserted into the link, which will be comprised of the users input. I recommend doing console logs to make sure you are linking to the correct part of the object from the API. You will need a function using forEach to append each gif into your container, also including the ability to use "still" and "animate," with on-click functionality. Functions for making buttons and appending into the container, as well as a function to push the input into the array and empty the input container from the user. Break the project down into pieces, and pseudo code the difficult parts. 

-Where users can get help with your project

I referenced the jquery website, previous projects and excercises, youtube, stack overflow, github, MDN, and w3 schools. There are alot of similar projects around, if you get stuck you can reference them, and research different methods needed via MDN and jquery.
